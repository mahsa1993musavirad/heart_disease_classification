# heart_disease_classification
This is a binary classification project on an imbalanced heart disease dataset. At first, we take a look at our data set and do some visualizations for understanding data. Then preprocessing steps like handling missing values, change the categorical columns to numeric, and normalization are done.  Different types of classification algorithms like  Naive Bayes classifier, knn, decision tree, svm, MLP are used on a heart disease dataset. Also, some ensemble methods are used for classification. We used GridSearch for finding the parameters of algorithms. A custom evaluation metric is defined and different algorithms are evaluated. Finally, the best algorithm is utilized for predicting unlabelled data.
